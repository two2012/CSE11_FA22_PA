# CSE 11 Fall 2022 PA3 - Calculator
**Due date: Thurs, Oct 20 @ 11:59PM PDT**

There is an [FAQ post](https://piazza.com/class/l871flmwsqy8i/post/271) on Piazza. Please read that post first if you have any questions.
 
## Provided Files
None

## Goal
In this assignment, we will practice implementing subroutines as methods for reusability and readability. We'll implement static methods with a variety of different return types and parameters.

## Overview

- Survey [Google Form, 1 point]
- Calculator [Gradescope, 99 points]
    - Implementation [94 points]
    - Style [5 points]

## Survey [1 Point]
Please fill out this weekly [survey](https://forms.gle/C5VgQVBJoyWHDHRm8) to receive one point.

## Calculator [99 Points]
In Java, doubles follow the [IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) and are **not accurately represented**. For example, when running the following code snippet,
```java
double firstNumber = 4.02;
double secondNumber = 0.05;
System.out.println(firstNumber + secondNumber);
```
we get `4.069999999999999` instead of `4.07`. 

There are different approaches to fix this unavoidable issue, such as [BigDecimal](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/math/BigDecimal.html). In this PA, you will be creating another solution, which is to implement the **addition of two doubles in a String representation**.

### Implementation [94 Points]
Your file should be named `Calculator.java` and should contain a single class `Calculator`.

#### Format of `Strings`
The Strings in this assignment each represent a double in String format. Strings are guaranteed to contain at least one digit and at most a single decimal point that can appear anywhere in the String. The `Invalid Examples` below will not be tested.

Valid Examples:
- `".1"`
- `"0.1"`
- `"00.1"`
- `"1"`
- `"1."`
- `"1.0"`

Invalid Examples:
  - `""`
  - `"."`
  - `"+1.0"`
  - `"-1.0"`
  - `"1.0f"`
  - `"1e9"`

#### Methods
<!-- **<span style="color:red">IMPORTANT: Do not import any libraries besides StringBuilder or cast the Strings into doubles or floats. Doing so will result in a 0 for this assignment.</span>** -->

> __Warning__ 
>
> Do not import or use any libraries such as `BigDecimal` or `Scanner`. You should not have any `import` statements for this PA.
>
> Additionally, do not parse the Strings into ints, doubles or floats using `Integer.praseInt`, `Integer.valueOf`, `Double.parseDouble`, `Double.valueOf`, `Float.parseFloat`, `Float.valueOf` etc. This includes using `new Integer(), new Double(), new Float()` since this is essentially parsing the String into ints, doubles and floats.
>
> Doing so will result in a 0 for this assignment.

You are free to create additional helper methods but make sure they are `private static`. 

**Number Extraction**

- `public static String extractWholeNumber(String number)`
  - Return the whole number part of the number without removing leading zeros.
  - If `number` contains no whole number part (e.g. `".1"`), return `"0"`.
  - E.g. `extractWholeNumber("012.340")` returns `"012"`
- `public static String extractDecimal(String number)`
   - Return the decimal part of the number without removing trailing zeros.
   - If `number` does not contain a decimal point or there are no digits after the decimal point (e.g. `"1", "1."`), return `"0"`.
   - E.g. `extractDecimal("12.340")` returns `"340"`

**Alignment and Formatting**

- `public static String prependZeros(String number, int numZeros)`
    - Return the result of prepending `numZeros` number of zeros to `number`.
    - If `numZeros` is negative, return `number`.
    - E.g. `prependZeros("1", 3)` returns `"0001"`

- `public static String appendZeros(String number, int numZeros)`
    - Return the result of appending `numZeros` number of zeros to `number`.
    - If `numZeros` is negative, return `number`.
    - E.g. `appendZeros("1", 3)` returns `"1000"`

- `public static String stripZeros(String number)`
    - Return the result of removing all leading and trailing zeros from `number` unless it is the only zero before or after the decimal.
    - E.g. `stripZeros("023.00")` returns `"23.0"`, `stripZeros("2300")` returns `"2300"`

**Single Digit Adder**
Your goal is to implement a single digit adder that adds 2 digits (`firstDigit` and `secondDigit`) and `carryIn` together. `firstDigit` and `secondDigit` are single digits represented by a `char` extracted from the inputs. `carryIn` is `true` when the addition in the previous column results in a [carry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_(arithmetic)); `false` if it does not.

- `public static char addDigits(char firstDigit, char secondDigit, boolean carryIn)`
    - Return the rightmost digit of the sum `firstDigit`, `secondDigit`, and `carryIn`.
    - If the sum has two digits and `carryIn` is false (i.e. '9' + '4' = '13'), return the rightmost digit `'3'`.
- `public static boolean carryOut(char firstDigit, char secondDigit, boolean carryIn)`
    - Return `true` if adding `firstDigit`, `secondDigit`, and `carryIn` results in a carry. Otherwise, return `false`.

- Examples
    - `('1', '6', true)`
    $1 + 6 + 1 = 8$, so `addDigits('1', '6', true)` returns `'8'`, and `carryOut('1', '6', true)` returns `false`.
    - `('1', '3', false)`
    $1 + 3 + 0 = 4$, so `addDigits('1', '3', false)` returns `'4'`, and `carryOut('1', '3', false)` returns `false`.
    - `('8', '5', true)`
    $8 + 5 + 1 = 14$, so `addDigits('8', '5', true)` returns `'4'`, and `carryOut('8', '5', true)` returns `true`.
    
#### Format of `Calculation` (add/multiply) Result
The two methods in the **Calculation** step below are `add` and `multiply`. The result for both of these methods should be a double in String format. If your results fall into the cases below where it does not satisfy the conditions mentioned, you need to handle it accordingly in the `add/multiply` methods.

Different cases:
- If there are no digits before the decimal point, prepend a `0`.
    - `".1"` $\to$ `"0.1"`
- If there is no decimal point, append a `.0`.
    - `"80"` $\to$ `"80.0"`
- If there is no digit after the decimal point, append a `0`.
    - `"80."` $\to$ `"80.0"`
- If there are leading or trailing zeros, then call `stripZeros`.
    - `"00010.200"` $\to$ `"10.2"`
- The result should always be in the decimal form. Do not use scientific / exponentital notation. 
    - If the result is 1 trillion, it should be `"1000000000000.0"`, not `"1e12"`.

    
**Calculation**
- `public static String add(String firstNumber, String secondNumber)`
    <!--     - Extract the whole number and decimal from `firstNumber`.
    - Extract the whole number and decimal from `secondNumber`.
    - Align the numbers and the decimal dot if needed.
        - Prepend zeros for the whole number in `firstNumber`.
        - Append zeros for the decimal in `secondNumber`.
    - Store the aligned `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`, and make sure they have the same length.
    - Add the digits from left to right and keep track of the carry. -->
    - Return the result of numerically adding the doubles (in String representation) together.
    - E.g. `add("100.5", "0.1")` returns `"100.6"`
    - **Hint:** Use the helper methods from above to implement add.
    
- `public static String multiply(String number, int numTimes)`
    - Return the result of adding the double (in String representation) for `numTimes`.
    - If `numTimes` is negative, return `number`.
    - E.g. `multiply("1", 3)` returns `"3.0"`

#### Walk Through for Addition
```java
System.out.print(Calculator.add("5.05", "10.05")); // should print 15.1
```

### Testing
For this PA, public testers can be found on Gradescope and there will be testers that are hidden that you will not be able to see. To help you test your code, we have included some of the hidden inputs as CSV files in the repository. It is your responsibility to test your program comprehensively. 

Here's an example of how you can test your code.

```java     
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.print(Calculator.add("4.02", "0.0050")); // should print 4.025
    System.out.print(Calculator.add("4.02", ".005"));   // should print 4.025
    System.out.print(Calculator.add("100", "200"));     // should print 300.0
    System.out.print(Calculator.multiply("100", 3));    // should print 300.0
}
```

### Style [5 Points]
Coding style is an important part of ensuring readability and maintainability of your code. We will grade your code style in all submitted code files according to the style guidelines. Namely, there are a few things you must have in each file/class/method:

1. File header
2. Class header
3. Method header(s)
4. Inline comments
5. Proper indentation
6. Descriptive variable names
7. No magic numbers
8. Reasonably short methods (if you have implemented each method according to specification in this write-up, youâ€™re fine). This is not enforced as strictly.
9. Lines shorter than 80 characters
10. Javadoc conventions (@param, @return tags, /** comments */, etc.)

A full style guide can be found [here](https://github.com/CaoAssignments/style-guide/blob/main/README.md) and a sample styled file can be found [here](https://github.com/CaoAssignments/style-guide/blob/main/SampleFile.java). If you need any clarifications, feel free to ask on Piazza.

## Submission & Grading
Submit the following file to Gradescope by **Thurs, Oct 20 @ 11:59PM PDT**.

- `Calculator.java`

**Important:** Even if your code does not pass all the tests, you will still be able to submit your homework to receive partial points for the tests that you passed. **Make sure your code compiles on Autograder in order to receive partial credit. The name of the file needs to be `Calculator.java`, otherwise no points will be given for the submission.**
